### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h3>About Me</h3>
I am __Shyam V__. I am a 3rd year Electronics and Communication Enginnering student. I am deeply interested in :unlock:__Cybersecurity__ and __Network Engineering__. I am also learning __Web Development__ to deploy _simple portfolios and websites_ and learn the related languages.

I am learning :jp:__Japanese__ now and I intend to learn many more languages in the coming years. And yes, I watch anime:grin:.

- :computer: I'm currently learning C/C++, Python, Web Development and Linux. 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: I'm beginning as a contributor right now, so I can help beginners to start their GitHub profile or help with Git.
